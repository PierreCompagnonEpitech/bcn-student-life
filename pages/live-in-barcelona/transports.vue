        <div class="mt-4">
            The transport zone system in Barcelona is a way of setting prices for transport tickets depending on the 
            distance of the destination from the centre of Barcelona. The further the distance to the destination the 
            higher the zone number and the higher the cost of the transport ticket. The transport system includes buses,
            trams, and the metro system. The city is divided into six zones, with Zone 1 being the most central zone and
            Zone 6 the outer most zone. Zone 1 area is often the most interesting as it contains Gothic Quarter, Sagrada Familia,
            Casa Mila, Casa Battlo and FC Barcelona etc. Barcelona International Airport is included in Zone 1 however
            a special metro ticket is needed to travel to BCN airport from the city centre.
