            distance of the destination from the centre of Barcelona. The further the distance to the destination the 
            higher the zone number and the higher the cost of the transport ticket. The transport system includes buses,
            trams, and the metro system. The city is divided into six zones, with Zone 1 being the most central zone and
            Zone 6 the outer most zone. Most tourist visitors to the city would only be interested in travelling in the
            Zone 1 area which has all the major Barcelona tourist attrations including Gothic Quarter, Sagrada Familia,
            Casa Mila, Casa Battlo and FC Barcelona etc. Barcelona International Airport is included in Zone 1 however
